<h3 style=font-family:helvetica><strong> Project Description </strong></h3><br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
In this project, I will perform a case study available by [Projeto Final de Data Analytics do Google](https://www.coursera.org/learn/projeto-final-conclua-um-estudo-de-caso?specialization=analise-de-dados-do-google). In the project, I will be part of a marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The team will be responsible for understanding how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. So, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process:<strong> ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act</strong>, to gain insights to answer the business task.

</h2>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
The first step in the data analysis process is the - Ask phase. To solve this problem, we must first define the business task, in other words, the question or problem that the data analysis will deal with, but firstly, we need to understand the whole context where the problem is embedded. In this way, we certify that weâ€™re focusing on the problem to be solved.
</font>

<br />


<!-- Understanding the context -->


<h3 style=font-family:helvetica><strong> Understanding the context </strong></h3><br />


<!-- Scenario -->


<h3 style=font-family:helvetica><strong> Scenario </strong></h3><br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica"> 
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
</font>
</p>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
<Strong>Cyclistic</strong>: A bike-share program that features more than 5.800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 geo-tracked and locked bikes within a network of 692 stations in Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans; single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers that purchase single-ride or full-day passes refer to casual riders. Customers that purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
Cyclistic's finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual passengers. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract customers, Lily Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be the key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets new customers, she believes there is a good chance to convert casual passengers into members. She notes that casual cyclists are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
</font>
</p>


<br />


<!-- Stakeholders -->


<h3 style=font-family:helvetica><strong> Stakeholders </strong></h3><br />

<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">

 * <strong>Lily Moreno</strong>: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

 * <strong>Cyclistic marketing analytics team</strong>: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic's mission and business goals - as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.

 * <strong>Cyclistic executive team</strong>: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will  decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
</font>
</p>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to
do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are
interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
</font>
</p>


<br />


<!-- Questions -->


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
<strong> 
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
</strong>
</font>
</p>


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why should casual riders buy Cyclistic annual membership?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

</font>
</p>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
<strong>
Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
</strong>
</font>
</p>

<br />

<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
With the business task defined, I will create a report with the following deliverables:

  1. A clear statement of the business task
  2. A description of all data sources used
  3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
  4. A summary of your analysis
  5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
  6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis

<!-- Gathering data -->


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
Now, we are in the second data analysis phase - Prepare. In this phase, I will collect data to perform the analysis. So, I will gather Cyclistic's trip historical data in the last 12 months.
</font>
</p>


<br />


<h3>
<font face="helvetica">
<strong> 
Download data and store it appropriately 
</strong>
</h3>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
All data collected was stored in my kaggle account. Thus all the data is stored in the cloud to ensure data security.
</font>
</p>


<br />


<h3>
<font face="helvetica">
<strong> 
Identify how data it's organized
</font>
</strong>
</h3>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
The data is in .csv files (comma-separated values) and is organized in rows and columns, which means it is structured. All collected datasets are separate, each representing one specific month of a Cyclistic's trip historical data in the last 12 months.    
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
To make the data more accessible, I implemented naming conventions, foldering, and archiving of old files. But firstly, I met with the team to create a file that describes the project's naming convention for easy reference to avoid any confusion with the team.
</font>
</p>


<br />


<h3>
<font face="helvetica">
<strong> 
Classify and filter the data
</font>

</h3>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
Were selected trip data from the last 12 months. In this case, the most recent data available were from March 2022 to February 2023.

<strong> 
Checking the data
</strong>
</h3>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
The data collected are historical and inclusive. So, we haven't found any problems or biases.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
The data I have collected is internal, is proven fit for use, the validity of the data has been certified with the source, have critical information needed to find the solution, and the data is current. Therefore, regarding credibility, the data is reliable, original, comprehensive, actual, and cited.
</font>
</p>


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
Examining the datasets, I confirm that the data is presented consistently with correct data types.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
The datasets don't have variables like genre, year of birth, and price plans. Having these variables, we could get more complete insights, but that doesn't stop us from performing the analysis.
</font>
</p>


<br />

<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
All the datasets provided by Cyclistic are public data and can be used to explore how different user types use Cyclistic's bikes. Moreover, it's secured that they're trustable, original, comprehensive, actual, and cited.

In the third data analysis phase - Process, we will process and clean the data, looking for duplicate, inaccurate, and incomplete data to dispose of any errors, inaccuracies, or possible inconsistencies. That ensures integrity in the data before analyzing it.
</font>
</p>


<br />

<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
In this analysis, I will use the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) (2023.03.0 Build 386) and the programming language R (Version 4.2.2), which is a tool with the ability to work in all data analysis process stages, as well as being a tool that allows work with large amounts of data.

I will also use Tableau for data visualization, creating effective graphs and dashboards.I will also use Tableau, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool that helps people see and understand data through beautiful and intuitive dashboards.

<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
With that in mind, I will create a new dataset only to get these records to analyze them.

<font size="3" face="helvetica">
To avoid distractions from our business task, I will consider that the error occurred due to software or research imputation errors.

<br />


* From 4.416.370 observations, we have 2.651.406 annual members, which represents 60.04%, and 1.764.964 casual users, which represents 39.96%, meaning that we have more annual members using Cyclistic's shared bikes.

* Annual members have used shared bikes with higher frequency during the days of the week, while casual users used them most during the weekend.

* Casual users usually use shared bikes with an average trip ride length higher than annual members on all days of the week.

* Annual members have the highest trip number from 04:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m., compared to casual users, from 11:00 p.m. until 03:00 a.m.

* Both Annual members and casual users have a preference for classic bikes. Annual members have realized more than 1.500.000 trips, representing 39.26% of total trips made, compared to 20.16% from casual users who made almost 900.000 journeys.

Key Findings

<h4>
<font face="helvetica">
<strong>
What story do the data tell?
</strong>
</font>
</h4>


<br />


<h5>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
<strong>
According to the analysis, the data tell us:
</strong>
</font>
</h5>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">

* Cyclistic has about 60.04% annual members and about 39.96% casual users. However, Cyclistic is mainly composed of Annual members.

* Throughout the 12-month data period, annual members were the most frequent riders, with the highest number of rides in the summer and the lowest in the winter. 

* During the week, Cyclistic has more than 500,000 cyclists making trips daily, with the highest number of trips made in the afternoon and the higher average trip duration on weekends.

* Annual members and casual users have a preference for classic bikes.

<strong>
How do annual members and casual users use Cyclistic bikes differently?
</strong>

</h4>


<br />


<h5>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
<strong>
The cyclists differ in the following way:
</strong>
</font>
</h5>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">

* Annual members use Cyclistic bikes during the week from 06:00 a.m. to 09:00 a.m. and from 03:00 p.m. to 07:00 p.m. at stations close to commercial, residential, and educational institutions areas such as universities and schools.

* Casual users take longer trips, ride more frequently on weekends, all at stations close to tourist attractions, and use Cyclistic bikes more than annual members, generally from 11:00 p.m. to 03:00 a.m.

<h3>
<font face="helvetica">
<strong>
Conclusion 
</strong>
</font>
</h3>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">

These findings allow us to conclude that annual members exhibit behaviors that indicate that they are customers who use Cyclistic bikes to go to work, educational institutions, and their homes.

Regarding casual users, some trends show that they are customers who use Cyclistic bikes for leisure and tourism, visiting Chicago's major tourist attractions.

<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
In the final step of the data analysis process - Act, I will provide stakeholders with three recommendations based on the findings so that they can make data-driven decisions.
</font>
</p>


<br />


<h3>
<font face="helvetica">
<strong>
Recommendations
</strong>
</font>
</h3>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">

1. Since casual users have two options for pricing plans: single-ride passes and full-day passes, the first recommendation would be to create a new weekend membership plan, as casual users tend to use Cyclistic's bikes more frequently during the weekend.

2. I also recommend creating another member plan for the months in the summer period, a summer plan, as casual users reached the highest number of rides in that period.

3. The third recommendation would make partnerships with hotels, restaurants, and tourist attractions during the summer period, offering benefits for casual users when becoming members.


</font>
</p>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">

Extra recommendations:

4. Increasing the number of classic bikes during the summer, as we know, we have a peak in the summer, and casual users and annual members prefer classic bikes.

5. Implement a reward program in the app, especially for members, where members earn points and accumulate them in their account for rewards to redeem later or exchange for extra time. This reward program can encourage casual users to become members as they make longer trips.

<strong>
Further Analysis
</strong>
</font>
</h3>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">
Having carried out the analysis, I'd like to point out that there are possibilities for further exploration, as the dataset did not include variables such as age, genre, and others, and we also have other ways of gaining more complete insights as I will mention below:
</font>
</p>


<br />


<p>
<font size="3" face="helvetica">

* Gather more data: (e.g. age, gender, address, prices) will give us more complete insights.

What is the age distribution of cyclists in the data?
How does the plan price affect the choice of users?

* Use external datasets: (e.g. Chicago temperature, Chicago public transportation).

May casual users be more likely to convert to annual members if Cyclistic establishes integration of cycling and public 
transportation in the member plan?

* Conduct a survey: Ask users relevant questions.

What is your primary reason for cycling? (e.g. commuting, exercise, leisure)?
Do you use any other modes of transportation with cycling?
How satisfied are you with the cycling infrastructure in your area?
